The biggest documentary film festival in Russia, founded in 2010 by Kirill Sorokin and Alena Bocharova. Beat Film Festival is held annually in Moscow at the end of May and the beginning of June. Over the years it has grown into a major cultural event that brings the best examples of contemporary documentary film about music, contemporary art, urbanism, street culture, fashion and new technologies to the attention of citizens. The mission of the festival is to form a cultural agenda and open the genre of documentary films for the wide public.

Each Beat Film Festival features dozens of full-length films, tens of thousands of viewers, screenings on major Moscow concert stages, and curatorial sections, working in partnership with well-known cultural institutions and media. The festival program includes Russian premieres of hits from prestigious international film festivals, a national competition to support young Russian documentary filmmakers, an educational program including discussions and public talk shows, special events and parties with Russian and international musicians and DJs.
